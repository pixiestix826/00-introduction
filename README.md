## Potential Difficulties :vertical_traffic_light:
Issues I predict for myself revolve around self-doubt; second guessing choices in code and anxiety from missing my family.  Although I haven't encountered a situation truly similar to this one, when I've experienced self-doubt and anxiety in the past I've turned to meditation and yoga.  I definitely see a consistent yoga practice helping me with this journey. :pray:

## Favorite Pre-Work :revolving_hearts:
I've really enjoyed all of the work I've been introduced to so far, but my favorites are HTML and CSS. I love watching things grow from boring to **beautiful**!  I recently had the opportunity to re-visit them with new lessons put up on Codecademy and I loved them even more after spending some time on Javascript, JQuery, and Ruby. I enjoy Javascript, but had issues sometimes remembering syntax. And omg, loops, arrays and anonymous functions...sometimes getting them to execute correctly makes me sweat, but they continue to teach me patience and determination. Command line was probably my least favorite, if I had to choose one.  I didn't dislike it, but found it a little less thrilling.

## Greatest Challenges to Date :mount_fuji:
+ Overcoming Self-Doubt
+ Remembering Syntax, which led to extra research
+ Loops, Formatting Complex Arrays, Anonymous Functions
+ Anything Involving Complicated Math :exclamation:
+ Being Slow due to all of the above
