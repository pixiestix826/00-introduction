## Potential Difficulties 
Issues I predict for myself revolve around self-doubt; second guessing choices in code and anxiety from missing my family.  Although I haven't encountered a situation truly similar to this one, when I've experienced self-doubt and anxiety in the past I've turned to meditation and yoga.  I definitely see a consistent yoga practice helping me with this journey. :pray:
#### Memory Triggered
Yesterday I hit the wall in the pre-work surrounding JavaScript, which speaks to potential difficulties I could face throughout this process. It reminded me of a time when I was in college so long ago and I was attempting College Algebra for the thrid time.  I knew I needed to drop it so my GPA wouldn't suffer, but I also knew it was a core requirement to complete any degree. I was frustrated and despressed because I didn't think I was smart enough to get through it.  I almost dropped out of school over it.  I did end up taking a short break and actually moved across the country where I eventually went back to school full time for Journalism at the University of Oregon.  I never did complete College Algebra because luckily for me, UO would allow Statistics to be used in place of Algegra.  I was still terrified because even the name, Statistics, sounds scary, but I earned a B in that class! However, I think because I was never able to complete the algebra course, I've carried self-doubt and been highly critical of myself, up to and including shying away from courses of study that interest me becuase they require math.

When I realized I was having difficulty with some core concepts of JavaScript, I felt that doubt and criticizm creep back up.  I had a moment of high anxiety and thoughts of quitting, but I took a deep breath, turned off my computer, spent some time with my kids, had a long talk with my husband and decided to read through the early chapters of *JavaScript & JQuery* by Jon Duckett. What I've learned over the years is that I cannot be great at everything, but I will always try my best.  I reminded myself that I've only been studying coding for a few short weeks and that many of these concepts, while complex, will not be impossible for me to understand given time and effort.  Additionally, I realized that maybe some things in JavaScript just aren't my thing, but that doesn't mean I can't be successful in other areas of this field.  Essentially what I'm saying is that I've learned different ways to handle my stressors and anxiety.  I no longer run away from the things that interest me because I'm afraid I will fail...fear does not define me.

## Favorite Pre-Work 
I've really enjoyed all of the work I've been introduced to so far, but my favorites are HTML and CSS. I love watching things grow from boring to **beautiful**!  I recently had the opportunity to re-visit them with new lessons put up on Codecademy and I loved them even more after spending some time on Javascript, JQuery, and Ruby. I enjoy Javascript, but had issues sometimes remembering syntax. And omg, loops, arrays and anonymous functions...sometimes getting them to execute correctly makes me sweat, but they continue to teach me patience and determination. Command line was probably my least favorite, if I had to choose one.  I didn't dislike it, but found it a little less thrilling.

## New Pre-Work, New Issues 
As with my earlier work, I am definitely more drawn to HTML and CSS when working through the newer assignments presented. I find myself sometimes avoiding jumping back into Javascript; specifically, CodeSchool's JavaScript Road Trip Part 3.  I felt really confident leaving RoadTrip 1  and RoadTrip 2 even, to a certain degree, but I'm feeling completely lost as I enter RoadTrip 3 section 2.  Primarily, my greatest challenge seems to be understanding global and local variables and how functions use them.  When complex math is included my brain tends to go on shut-down mode. I'm reading through the forums for help and will continue to push through, but will also look for other explanations to help me further understand these concepts, including working through some of the Treehouse lessons on Javascript. So far I have enjoyed working in Treehouse more than Codeschool, but that could be based solely on the fact that most of my work through Treehouse has been on HTML and CSS concepts.

## Greatest Challenges to Date 
+ Overcoming Self-Doubt
+ Remembering Syntax, which led to extra research
+ Loops, Formatting Complex Arrays, Anonymous Functions
+ Global and Local Variables when presented in more complex functions, specifically Closures.
+ Anything Involving Complicated Math :exclamation:
+ Being Slow due to all of the above
